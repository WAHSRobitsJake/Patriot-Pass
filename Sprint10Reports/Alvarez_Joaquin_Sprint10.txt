Joaquin Alvarez Sprint 10:

- Did bug fixes that for the Game Over UI as well as the timer. Made sure that the Game ended correctly and there was no further issues. 
- Fix the aspect ratio bug as well for the Post-game Freeze bug in scene 2.
- Added key movement for the End Game Menu. Now users are able to navigate the End game menu through the keys instead of using the mouse for now on.
