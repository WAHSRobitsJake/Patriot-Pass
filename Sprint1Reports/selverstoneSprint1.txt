>Reviewed 410 lines of code from my programmers and created a global variable to track information across scenes
	-On the playerMovementHandler I reviewed Isaac's work and edited it to flow better within my programming framework as well as optimizing
	 the way movement is done. Fixed issues with general movement and dashing.
	-Additionally on the playerMovementHandler I added a tracker when the player entered "puckState" that tracked how long the keys were held
	 for. This was then translated using trigonometric math into an angle. That angle will then be translated into coordinates on the unit
	 circle that will serve as a framework for baseline addition of force.
	-On the puckScript I removed its ability to store score and made pointers to the gameManager where score will be stored
	-On the diskMovement script I changed the way the disk interacts with the player and enabled it to find the empty gameObject where it
	 will be held. Fixed an issue where it found the player's transform as opposed to its child's transform.
>Held meetings with each of my programmers checking in on their progress and making myself available to answer questions and provide assistance
 with any issues they ran into.
