I messaged one of the programmers to ensure the UI work flow in functional. I didn't see any issues with programming wise. However, I made a suggestion to the programmer to use anchor points to make sure the UI stays on the canvas. Since when I first launched it, I couldn't even see the UI becuase of the aspect ratio. So I suggested and showed pictures of anchor points for the UI.
