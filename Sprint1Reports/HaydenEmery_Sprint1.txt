Attempted recording basic sound effects such as impacts and whoosh noises as well as bonus opportunities such as a coach whistle I found. However, the majority of the sounds had quit a bit of white noise and interveriance, and editing them is not yeilding what I want. Was a good learning oportunity to get back in the groove of foley, if largly a failure. Did finally  find some of my old raw recorded audio of mine that may be usefull, none of which has been edited.
