Build Version: Tuesday Build ;Version 0.2.1 
Reproduction Techniques: In title screen, click on options
Observed Behavior: The UI is very off center and the sliders do not slide or work at all. The buttons do not work either, I cant even go back to the title screen.
Expected Behavior: The UI should be more in the center. The slider should move at least. The back bottom should take me back to the title screen.
Priority Level: High
