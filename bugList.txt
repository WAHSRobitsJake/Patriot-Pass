High Priority (Next Office Hours)
[Fixed!](3/23/2022)-Loki clips through Sarah when trying to Lerp between targets
[Fixed!](3/22/2022)-Time Distortion ability not working properly, pucks leaving the field would leave at hyper speeds and the incorrect function was called to activate the ability
[Fixed!](3/22/2022)-sandstorm not decreasing its alpha value (opacity) please help I've tried so many things
[Fixed!](3/22/2022)-puck retains momentum after colliding with player post starship 3bar Ult
[Fixed!](3/22/2022)-puvk retains momentum after colliding with starship 2bar ult
[Fixed!](3/21/2022)-player does not get a knockback from colliding with the starship 3bar ult
-tie ultBar to the images on the overlay
-Adapting the game to the larger, more correctly scaled map
-Second menu does not prompt a decision with keys (levels 1-4)
-Pause menu not working correctly on testScene2, not able to navigate with keys
-Debug officers, slerping not the most optimal way to make them track the player, remove collision with Gary as well perhaps
[Fixed!](3/6/2022)-Multiple jumps breaks the functionality
[Fixed!](2/28/2022)-.dwlt and User setting annoying AF
[Fixed!](2/28/2022)-Not able to jump even though canJump is true and movement isn't restricted in Z axis
[Fixed!](2/28/2022)-Still need to launch disk in the last direction of the starshipUltPrefab movement vector
[Fixed!](2/28/2022)-SarahLoki extra prefabs instantiating twice when it should only be made once, not sure why. Using a for loop in the start() function to find the
         right player and create the prefabs in the right spot. Small issues with how the prefabs operate
		[Fixed!](2/28/2022)-New Bug: Loki teleports to the position as opposed to moving towards it, minor fix I'm sure will handle it
[Fixed!](2/28/2022)-When trying to throw the puck sometimes it moves a smudge then makes you have to press x again to throw it (testscene03) - high 
[Feature](2/28/2022)-When player one catches the puck can sometimes still move a tiny bit. (testscene02)
[Removed](2/28/2022)-When player tries to throw the puck with backward input the player jerks backward (testscene02)
[Fixed!](3/20/2022)-Pressed C while LEFT player had puck, couldnt control starship drone with WASD, but could be controled with arrow keys mirroring the movements with right player
(continuation) resulted in left player unable to move or throw

Medium Priority (Within the Week)
-Dieterich ability not triggering from fieldState
-Pause menu not working on level 3
-Enable the pressing and holding of the volume slider to adjust speed as opposed to repeated presses
-When player tries to drop shot the puck sometimes it just floats horizontally (test scene 03)// -- medium 
[Fixed!](3/2/2022)-2bar Starship ult not accurately changing direction on Invoke("changeY"). The function is being called but not being reflected on screen(game still functions
without it working so we can prioritize other bugs)
	-2bar Starship Ult accurately changes direction but slows down and pushes the player back (though we may want that to persist, possible feature) [?]
-When coming off the main menu the lighting is super dark there are lots of shadows - same throwing glitches occur as well ever now and then(Test scene 01)
[Removed](2/28/2022)-When player sometimes tries to throw the puck they just jerk in place (testscene 02)

Low Priority (SoonTM)
-Players start out at a faster speed than normal, once they change states their speed gets set to a constant value
-Level 4 button does not work
